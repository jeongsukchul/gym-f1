## Installation

### Quickstart

Gym-Khana is available as a PyPI package with only the gym environment, or as a full repository with additional functionality.

Install the gym environment from PyPI with:

```bash
pip install gymkhana
```

Alternatively, to use all features, or for development (training, controllers, analysis, etc.), clone the full repo and install dependencies using `conda`:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/TeoIlie/Gym-Khana.git
cd Gym-Khana
conda create -n gymkhana python=3.11 -y
conda activate gymkhana
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs Gym-Khana in editable mode and includes the development, training, and documentation dependencies.

You can also install the same dependency groups using `poetry`:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/TeoIlie/Gym-Khana.git
cd Gym-Khana
poetry install --all-groups
source $(poetry env info -p)/bin/activate # or instead of sourcing, prefix commands with `poetry run`
```

Then you're off to the races! 🏎️

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeoIlie/Gym-Khana/main/figures/F1TENTH_PPO_Drift.gif)

You can run a quick waypoint follow example:

```bash
cd examples
python3 waypoint_follow.py
```

Or a simple centerline follow example:
```bash
cd examples
python3 controller_example.py
```

### Additional Dependencies

MPC controllers require dependencies that cannot be installed via pip alone. For the reference MPC implementation see the ForzaETH [race_stack](https://github.com/ForzaETH/race_stack)

Skip this section unless you plan to run the MPC examples/controllers (`examples/kmpc_race_example.py`, `examples/stmpc_race_example.py`, or `controller_type="stmpc"`).

**acados** (build from source) — see the official [installation docs](https://docs.acados.org/installation/index.html) and [Python interface docs](https://docs.acados.org/python_interface/index.html):

```bash
# acados (build from source) - ~/software is only an example install directory
git clone https://github.com/acados/acados.git --recurse-submodules ~/software/acados
cd ~/software/acados && mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DACADOS_WITH_QPOASES=ON ..
make install -j$(nproc)

# Environment variables (add to shell profile)
export ACADOS_SOURCE_DIR=~/software/acados
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/software/acados/lib

```

Next, install the `acados_template` inside your virtual environment, with editable mode. For example, open a shell inside the virtual env with `poetry shell` and then run the following command:

```bash
# Python interface
pip install -e ~/software/acados/interfaces/acados_template
```

## Training

The main racing training script is at `train/ppo_race.py`. The recovery training script is at `train/ppo_recover.py`. Both include functionality for:
1. **Train** (`--m t`): Train a new model with parallel environments using `SubprocVecEnv` and `train/config` params
2. **Evaluate** (`--m e`): Evaluate a trained model with visualization
3. **Download** (`--m d`): Fetch a model from **wandb** and evaluate it
4. **Continue** (`--m c`): Continue training an existing model from a checkpoint
5. **Transfer** (`--m f`): Transfer a pretrained model to a new task, preserving network weights but resetting optimizer, LR schedule, and optionally resetting `log_std` for fresh exploration, and resetting critic network for fresh value approximation. Useful for transferring learned dynamics knowledge (e.g. racing to recovery).

For example, train a racing model with:

```bash
python3 train/ppo_race.py --m t
```

Detailed usage guidelines are at the top of the training script files.

Fresh training runs apply a `log_std` schedule that linearly anneals the policy's action noise from `init` to `end` across total timesteps (configured in `train/config/rl_config.yaml` under `log_std_schedule`). This closes the stochastic-vs-deterministic train/eval gap that otherwise arises with SB3's default `log_std_init=0`. Comment out the block to disable.

### Wandb

By default, all training models are synced to **wandb**, with training data for runs saved to `/wandb` folder.

To login to your account, use `wandb login`. To create an account, visit <https://wandb.ai>

### ONNX Policy Conversion

To use policies in other packages, such as a ROS2 package for sim-to-real transfer, we provide support for converting an SB3 model to ONNX type. Use `train/export_onnx.py` for conversion:

```bash
python3 train/export_onnx.py --path <SB3 model path>
```

Run the policy with ONNX using `OnnxPolicyRunner` defined in `gymkhana/inference/onnx_runner.py`. For example for a racing policy:

```bash
python3 train/ppo_race.py --m x --path <ONNX model path>
```

## Sim2Real Transfer

Tools for narrowing the gap between simulated training and real-vehicle deployment.

### Domain Randomization

At each reset, selected vehicle parameters are perturbed by multiplicative Gaussian noise `θ' = θ · X`, `X ~ N(1, σ)`, clipped at `±dr_clip_k·σ` (default `3.0`). Configured via the `domain_randomization` gym key as a flat `{param: sigma}` dict (σ in `(0, 0.2)`); absent or `None` disables DR. Train configs (`get_drift_train_config`, `get_recovery_train_config`) inject DR from `train/config/gym_config.yaml`; eval always uses nominal parameters.

```yaml
# train/config/gym_config.yaml
domain_randomization:
  m: 0.05         # mass
  I_z: 0.02       # yaw inertia
  lf: 0.05        # CoG fore-distance; lr auto-tracks (wheelbase preserved)
  s_max: 0.03     # max steering angle; s_min auto-mirrors
  sv_max: 0.02    # max steering velocity; sv_min auto-mirrors
```

For coupled pairs, randomize only the canonical member (`lf`, `s_max`, `sv_max`). The derived partner (`lr`, `s_min`, `sv_min`) is recomputed each reset; listing it raises `ValueError` pointing to the canonical key.

## Configuration

### Default Gym/RL configurations

For PyPI users (or anyone who wants a one-liner), the package exposes a `drift_config` preset bundling sensible STD-model drift defaults:

```python
import gymnasium as gym
from gymkhana import drift_config

env = gym.make("gymkhana:gymkhana-v0", config=drift_config(map="Drift"))
```

Keyword args override individual fields (`drift_config(num_agents=2, normalize_obs=False)`).

For training workflows, full configurations are stored in `/train/config/env_config.py`, with parameters coming from `train/config/rl_config.yaml` and `train/config/gym_config.yaml`. This exposes all Gym env and RL params for training, plus convenience functions for getting Gym configs of RL training and testing environments (built on top of `drift_config` with training-specific keys layered on):

1. `/train/config/env_config.py::get_drift_test_config()`
2. `/train/config/env_config.py::get_drift_train_config()`
3. `/train/config/env_config.py::get_recovery_test_config()`
4. `/train/config/env_config.py::get_recovery_train_config()`

### Callback and Curriculum Learning (CL) configuration

Default `SB3` callbacks used during training are `WandbCallback`, `CheckpointCallback`, and `EvalCallback`. A custom `CurriculumLearningCallback` is also available, which gradually expands the recovery state initialization ranges as the agent's success rate improves. A custom `ObsMinMaxSnapshotCallback` is also attached automatically when `record_obs_min_max` is enabled — it writes periodic snapshots of merged per-subproc obs min/max trackers to `outputs/config/<run_id>/obs_min_max.yaml` and logs per-feature bounds-violation magnitudes to wandb.

CL is configured in `/train/config/gym_config.yaml` under the `curriculum` heading by setting `enabled: true`. Parameters such as `n_stages`, `success_threshold`, and per-state ranges (`v_range`, `beta_range`, etc.) can be tuned there.

Note that CL is only supported for recovery training, with the environment `training_mode` set to `"recover"`. Recovery training is accessed through the training script `train/ppo_recover.py`.

### Debugging configuration

 `gym.make()` configurations:
 
1. Run with `render_mode` set to `human` to visualize the process
2. Set `"render_track_lines": True` (it is `False` by default) to render the centerline  in **green** and the raceline in **red**
3. Rendering track arc-length points **s** in Frenet coordinates at discrete intervals:
    1. First, `"render_arc_length_annotations": True` (it is `False` by default) to render points along the centerline in **orange** 
    2. Optionally, also set `"arc_length_annotation_interval"` to modify the point spacing (`2.0` metres by default)
4. Set `"render_lookahead_curvatures": True` (it is `False` by default) to visualize lookahead curvature sampling points ahead of the vehicle in **yellow**. Optional parameters:
5. Set `"debug_frenet_projection" = True` to visualize the Frenet coordinates are correct
6. Set `"record_obs_min_max"` to `True/False` to record min/max observation values during training, and tweak normalization bounds if necessary, defined in `utils.py::calculate_norm_bounds`. Min/max are aggregated across parallelized environments and supported regardless of whether `normalize_obs` is enabled. When enabled during training, a YAML snapshot is written periodically to `outputs/config/<run_id>/obs_min_max.yaml`, and per-feature bounds-violation magnitudes (`obs_bounds/<feature>/over` and `.../under`) are streamed to wandb for live monitoring
7. Set `"render_config"` to a dict of field overrides for the packaged `gymkhana/envs/rendering/rendering.yaml` — e.g. `{"window_size": 1200, "render_type": "pygame", "show_ctr_debug": True}`. Omitted fields keep their yaml defaults. This is the preferred way to tweak rendering when `gymkhana` is installed from PyPI
8. Set `"prevent_instability"` to `True/False` to enable post-RK4 sanity checks on the standardized state. When enabled, integrator blow-ups are detected, the agent's state is reverted, the episode is truncated, and the running event count is logged to wandb under `instability/total` and printed at end-of-run. The bounds are configurable via `"instability_yaw_rate_bound"` (default `4π` rad/s) and `"instability_slip_bound"` (default `π/2` rad). When disabled, the env behaves as before — no detection, no revert, no truncation

#### Control debug panel

Set `show_ctr_debug: True` via the `render_config` gym option (or in `gymkhana/envs/rendering/rendering.yaml` for repo users) to enable a real-time control debug panel below the map (PyQt6 renderer only). The panel shows:

- **Actual vehicle state**: current steering angle (`delta`) and longitudinal velocity (`v_x`) in white
- **Control commands**: raw steering and throttle commands with their bounds, colour-coded to match their bars (steering in blue, throttle in green)
- **Two zero-centered horizontal bar gauges**: each bar spans the command's full range with the fill extending from zero toward the current value, making the sign and magnitude of each command instantly visible

The panel tracks the currently followed agent (switched via mouse click), defaulting to the ego agent in map view. It is disabled by default to avoid overhead during training.

#### Observation debug overlay

Set `show_obs_debug: True` via the `render_config` gym option (or in `gymkhana/envs/rendering/rendering.yaml` for repo users) to overlay all observation values on top of the map in the top-left corner (PyQt6 renderer only). The overlay displays:

- **Feature names and values**: each observation feature as a key-value pair (e.g., `linear_vel_x: 2.3451`)
- **Array summaries**: large arrays like LiDAR scans show count, min, max, and mean; small arrays (e.g., lookahead curvatures) show all values
- **Normalization indicator**: shows `[norm: on]` when observation normalization is active; values are always displayed in raw physical units regardless of normalization

Works with all observation types (`OriginalObservation`, `FeaturesObservation`, `VectorObservation`). For multi-agent environments, the overlay shows the followed agent's observations. Disabled by default to avoid overhead during training.

### `gym.make()` Options

1. Set `training_mode` to define the training goal. This modifies the reset, initialization, track, and reward settings:
    1. `"race"` (default) is used by `train/ppo_race.py` for training racing policies 
    2. `"recover"` is used by `train/ppo_recover.py` to train policies for stabilizing an out-of-control vehicle 
2. Set `model` to define vehicle dynamics:
    1. `ks` - Kinematic Single Track (no tire forces)
    2. `st` - Single Track (lateral dynamics, no explicit tire model)
    3. `stp` - Single Track Pacejka, dynamic single-track with lateral-only Pacejka Magic Formula tire model (ported from the ForzaETH f110-simulator). Shares ST's 7-d state layout
    4. `std` - Single Track Drift with PAC2002 tire model (recommended for drift RL training)
    5. `mb` - Multi-Body (full-scale parameters only)
3. Use `control_input` `["accl", "steering_angle"]` for best RL drift training
4. Use parameter dictionary `params` as `GKEnv.f1tenth_std_vehicle_params()` or `GKEnv.f1tenth_std_drift_bias_params()` for drift parameters on 1/10 scale F1TENTH car, or `GKEnv.f1tenth_stp_vehicle_params()` for the STP model
5. Lookahead curvature/width observations can be configured with spacing and number parameters, and when `render_lookahead_curvatures": True` these will be reflected
    1. `lookahead_n_points` - Number of lookahead points (default: 10)
    2. `lookahead_ds` - Spacing between points in meters (default: 0.3m)
    3. `sparse_width_obs` - `False` passes all lookahead point width values as observation, `True` only passes 1st and last. `True` is useful when track width varies very little (default: `False`)
6. Set `normalize_obs` to `True/False` for normalizing the observation space. Only specific observation types can be normalized
7. Set `normalize_act` to `True/False` for normalizing the action space. Supported for all action types
8. Set `predictive_collision` to `True` to use TTC collision checking and `False` for Frenet-based collision checking. Note that this also modifies the reward function.
9. Set `wall_deflection` to `False` to treat track edges as boundaries, and `True` to treat them as walls that cause a collision and halt the vehicle
10. Reward configuration options:
    1. `progress_gain`: set amount of gain by which to multiply forward progress reward. Must be >= 1
    2. `out_of_bounds_penalty`: penalty for driving off the track boundary
    3. `negative_vel_penalty`: penalty for driving backward
    4. `max_episode_steps`: the maximum number of episode steps
11. Set `track_direction` to define in which direction to drive around the track:
    1. `normal` (default): drive around the track in the direction of the waypoints stored in the centerline and raceline files (Note this may be CW or CCW depending on the track map)
    2. `reverse`: drive around in the opposite direction (For ex, CW instead of CCW)
    3. `random`: randomly drive in the 'regular' or 'reverse' direction at each reset with a 50% chance, to learn left and right cornering equally when training a policy with RL

### `env.reset()` Options

1. **Poses** and **States** can be used to initialize vehicles at specific configurations. Note:
   - Only one of `poses` or `states` can be used per reset call (not both)
   - All **[x, y, yaw]** values are in Cartesian coordinates
   - To use Frenet coordinates, convert first using `frenet_to_cartesian()` in `gymkhana/envs/track/track.py`

2. **Poses**: Reset agents at a specific pose
   ```python
   # Single agent
   poses = np.array([[x, y, yaw]])
   env.reset(options={"poses": poses})

   # Multiple agents
   poses = np.array([[x1, y1, yaw1],
                     [x2, y2, yaw2]])
   env.reset(options={"poses": poses})
   ```

3. **States**: Reset agents to a full 7-d state (only for `model='std'`)
   ```python
   # Single agent: [x, y, delta, v, yaw, yaw_rate, slip_angle]
   states = np.array([[x, y, delta, v, yaw, yaw_rate, slip_angle]])
   env.reset(options={"states": states})

   # Front & rear angular wheel velocities are automatically initialized to form the full 9-d state for STD model type
   ```

   For the STD model an explicit **9-element** row is also accepted, in which case the front and rear wheel angular velocities `omega_f`, `omega_r` (rad/s) are taken as given rather than derived from the no-slip rolling assumption. Useful for sysid / replay where the simulator must start from an exact measured state. The caller owns consistency between `v` and the wheel speeds.
   ```python
   # [x, y, delta, v, yaw, yaw_rate, slip_angle, omega_f, omega_r]  (STD only)
   states = np.array([[x, y, delta, v, yaw, yaw_rate, slip_angle, omega_f, omega_r]])
   env.reset(options={"states": states})
   ```

## Customization

### Custom Maps

Custom maps can be created using the git submodule <https://github.com/TeoIlie/F1TENTH_Racetracks> stored in folder `/maps`. Once updated, pull the update submodule with `git pull --recurse-submodules`

### Tire Parameters

* Parameters for the 1/10 scale f1tenth car to be used with the `STD` model are defined in `gymkhana/envs/gymkhana_env.py` as `f1tenth_std_vehicle_params`. They are created as a mix of existing f1tenth params and tire parameters adjusted from the fullscale car.
* In future I may measure these parameters from real data for more accurate fitting
* To maintain a history of parameter choices, and how they compare with the correct behaviour on the fullscale car, tests script `tests/model_validation/test_f1tenth_std_params.py` creates comparison figures along with parameter YAML file dump ordered by date created inside folder `figures/tire_params`

## Development

### Formatting/Linting

Run formatting and auto-fixes manually with `ruff check --fix . && ruff format .` Fixes also are applied before commits due to `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file, with `pre-commit` dependency.

### Documentation

* Documentation is supported through ReadTheDocs Sphinx template at https://gym-khana.readthedocs.io
* Tagged versions are available via the version selector in the docs (bottom-left flyout)
* To update documentation modify `/docs` folder files and test locally, a rebuild will be triggered on push to default branch

```bash
cd docs
make clean && make html && firefox _build/html/index.html
```

### Versioning

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

* **MAJOR**: Breaking changes (incompatible API/config changes)
* **MINOR**: New features (backward-compatible)
* **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward-compatible)

To release a new version:

1. Move items from `[Unreleased]` to a new version section in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)
2. Update `version` in `pyproject.toml` and `__version__` in `gymkhana/__init__.py`
3. Create and push a matching annotated git tag:

```bash
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "description of release"
git push origin v1.2.0
```

Pushing the tag automatically publishes to TestPyPI and PyPI via the `publish.yml` GitHub Actions workflow.


## Known Issues

* Library support issues on Windows. You must use Python 3.8 as of 10-2021

* On MacOS Big Sur and above, when rendering is turned on, you might encounter the error:

```
ImportError: Can't find framework /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework.
```

You can fix the error by installing a newer version of pyglet:

```bash
pip3 install pyglet==1.5.11
```

And you might see an error similar to

```
gym 0.17.3 requires pyglet<=1.5.0,>=1.4.0, but you'll have pyglet 1.5.11 which is incompatible.
```

which could be ignored. The environment should still work without error.
